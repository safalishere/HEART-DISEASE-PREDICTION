# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION
Preventing heart diseases has become increasingly crucial in today's healthcare landscape. The development of robust, data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases has the potential to enhance research and prevention efforts, ensuring a healthier population. Machine Learning plays a pivotal role in this scenario, providing accurate predictions for heart diseases.

The project involved a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing information about heart disease patients, with meticulous data processing. Subsequently, various machine learning models were trained using different algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and more. The code and dataset used in this Kaggle kernel titled 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras' are shared below.

In this classification problem, the objective is to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on a range of input features. The machine learning algorithms employed include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (Linear), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost, implemented using Scikit-learn and Keras.

The achieved accuracy for the models varied, with the Random Forest algorithm showing the highest accuracy at 95%.
